# Problem

I want to understand how Markdown editors work.

# Solution

I am writing this test post and learn Markdown in a bit more details.
Afterwards I will use the Markdown to create a new Blog on [Github Pages Blog](https://sebastiandemmer.github.io/)

I can include icons and images:

Now I see that image sizing is not part of Markdown and I will need to use Jekyll HTML snippets for that.

I can create bulletpoint like this:
- One
- Two
- Three
